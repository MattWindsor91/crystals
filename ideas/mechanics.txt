RobDonkey's ideas, of which I agree or would be OK with:

- No crystals; instead use a points-based system where each summon costs
  points to use in battle, and the amount of points the player can use 
  depends on experience, progress in the game etc. [Agree, especially on 
  trying a points-based system.]

- ^-- The above is similar to the Warhammer system.

- The unit of points should be "spiritual energy."

- Use AI for battles with other people, and possibly more random actions for 
  "wild" spirits? [Definitely think AI should be stronger/more prominent for 
  people battles, as a "human" is commanding the spirits, whereas wild 
  spirits will be less "controlled".]

- Creatures should have outside battle powers, such as healing, etc. 
  All creatures should have one. [Agree.]

- The above uses a form of power. [Agree.]

- Recharge at special points (obelisks?)

Own ideas:

- As creatures grow stronger and/or learn new things, their point requirement 
  (if using points) should go up, causing the player to have to think about 
  whether expanding a creature's abilities will make the creature consume too 
  many points to be useable in battle.

- If point limits, some battles should have artificially lower point limits, 
  forcing the player to have to maintain a reserve of "weaker" spirits in 
  order to enter. Some battles could have minimum point levels!
